Project Design Process: (aspects of the project design that contributed to its success/failure) \\u2022 The project was well designed, drawing strongly on BirdLife\\u2019s experience in strategic planning and capacity development of NGOs. \\u2022 Retaining an output on project management and technical support was helpful (output 5) to keep track of the secretariat and Africa Partnership\\u2019s role. \\u2022 The decision to appoint key staff from the previous BirdLife (Projet ZICOMA) team, but then recruit additional staff openly, was successful in ensuring a solid BirdLife \\u201Ccore\\u201D in the team, but allowing new skills to be added. \\u2022 The decision not to have a permanent expatriate technical adviser was successful in ensuring national ownership and compatibility with Asity (national NGO); at no time was this ever questioned. However, more time should have been budgeted for headquarters staff time (country programme officer): 50-75% (not one month, or <10%) of the time of a headquarters staff member would have been justified, and still much cheaper than an permanent adviser. Project Execution: (aspects of the project execution that contributed to its success/failure) \\u2022 For training, internships, BirdLife network events and on-the-job training were preferred over training courses delivered by external agencies. This proved economical and generally successful. \\u2022 Involvement of the BirdLife Africa Partnership was critical to the NGO development objectives, because the Partners (rather than secretariat) are in the best position to demonstrate the value of joining the network, and also because the Partnership itself determines whether or not a Malagasy organization will be admitted. This took place in two main ways. The chair of the Council for the African Partnership (Kinfe Abebe of the Ethiopian Wildlife and Natural History Society) attended the BIMP-Asity collaboration workshop in June 2003, and was able to explain at first hand the benefits to national NGOs of being a BirdLife Partner. The president of Asity (together with the director of BIMP) attended the Africa Partnership meeting in September, meeting representatives of all the Partners, and participating in the regional planning process. \\u2022 Involvement of the BirdLife African Partnership secretariat in Nairobi (that is, the Africa Division of the BirdLife secretariat, as distinct from the Partnership itself, as described above) was also critical to NGO development objectives, because the staff have unique experience in facilitating the development and cohesion of national NGOs and networks. Key staff directly involved through visits to Madagascar and hosting internships in Nairobi were Hazell Thompson (head) and Maaike Manten (institutional fundraiser for Africa). \\u2022 Close cooperation and frequent communication between the BIMP team (and latterly also Asity) and the secretariat headquarters helped to ensure success. Attention to detail and rapid correspondence were key parts of this, and so it was crucial that the country   8 programme officer (project manager) in UK was able allocate the necessary time. This work entails considerable UK-based costs and may be seen as administration, making it hard to fund. However, as this report makes clear, the support given is in fact largely technical, and the country programme officer system provides an economical way to provide the support needed. \\u2022 The advice and support from CI as a like-minded NGO with a strong presence in Madagascar, and from CEPF as a donor with an exceptional level of commitment to seeing projects succeed, were essential to overall success. In addition to CEPF staff, whose contribution to the success of the project was greatly appreciated, Olivier Langrand (CI \\u2013 Washington DC) provided crucial advice in the design of the project, and Frank Hawkins (CI \\u2013 Madagascar) advised throughout, often by giving guidance directly to the BIMP team. \" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n",
